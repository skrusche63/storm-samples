storm-samples
=============

This repository holds a collection of storm topologies, we have made experience with at 
[Dr. Krusche & Partner](http://www.dr-kruscheundpartner.de). We share the respective Spout & Bolt 
definitions with the hope that they are useful.

**Storm** is an open source real-time computation framework, which was developed at Twitter and is sometimes referred 
to as "real-time Hadoop." Whereas Hadoop relies on batch processing, Storm is a real-time, distributed, fault-tolerant system. 
Like Hadoop, it can process huge amount of data, but does so in real time with guaranteed reliability. This means, that 
every incoming message will be processed. 

Storm also offers features such as fault tolerance and distributed computation, which make it suitable for processing 
huge amounts of data on different machines.
